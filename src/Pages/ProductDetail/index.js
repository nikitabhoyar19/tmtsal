            As you know that the steel, metals have a bad reputation in matters
            of environment friendly products because some machines that cause
            harm to the environment are made up of metal but metal is a natural
            element which is found in earth. So we can resume the waste which
            comes from steel as steel produces rocky substances which most of
            the companies use in construction as cement. We use water heavily
            during the steel making process and this water is filled in various
            particles which can be removed through filtration and 98% of water
            can be recycled.{" "}
