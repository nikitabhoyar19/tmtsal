              <h2>Eco Friendly</h2>
              <p>
                As you know that the steel, metals have a bad reputation in
                matters of environment friendly products because some machines
                that cause harm to the environment are made up of metal but
                metal is a natural element which is found in earth. So we can
                resume the waste which comes from steel as steel produces rocky
                substances which most of the companies use in construction as
                cement. We use water heavily during the steel making process and
                this water is filled in various particles which can be removed
                through filtration and 98% of water can be recycled.
