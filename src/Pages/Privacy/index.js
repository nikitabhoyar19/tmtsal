          <h3>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h3>
          <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from
            children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
            (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the
            nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
            spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to
            protect children’s privacy and safety online. We do not specifically
            market to children under 13.
          </p>

          <h3>Fair Information Practices</h3>
          <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
            privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
            played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
            around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
            with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
          </p>

          <h4>
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
            the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
          </h4>

          <h3>We will notify the users via email</h3>
          <p>∙ Within 7 business days</p>

          <h3>We will notify the users via in site notification</h3>
          <p>∙ Within 7 business days</p>
          <p>
            We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires
            that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights
            against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
            law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
            enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
            have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or
            prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
          </p>

          <h3>CAN SPAM Act</h3>

            establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients
            the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells
            out tough penalties for violations. We collect your email address in
            order to: To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the
